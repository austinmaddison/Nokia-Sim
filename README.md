This project's inital goal was just to try out **Godot 4.3**. 
I wanted to see how far I could push visual fidelity and its shader system.
Chose a classic game to reimplement, Nokia's original Snake.

Current features
* A failtful nokia dev LCD module model and shader. 
    * LCD Shader
        * Substrate Parralax Shadows/Ghosting
        * 2D Viewport Substrate
        * Backlight Diffuser Sparkles
        * Backlight
        * Fake Frame Shadows
        * Top Layer Specular and Color Imprefections - Scratches, Smear and Subtle Dirt


I am now hoping to somehow make an actual Nokia emulator in Godot... stay tuned?
